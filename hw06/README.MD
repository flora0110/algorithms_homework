>Your program will take an integer arrays as input.  
>Please return the maximum possible number of blocks in a valid partitioning.  
>A valid partitioning of the integer array is defined as follows.  
>The numbers are split into blocks — groups of consecutive numbers. The blocki,j consists of number ni, ni + 1, ..., nj. A block can have only a single number.  
>Every number belongs to one block only.  
>The partitioning should satisfy the condition that after each block is sorted, the whole sequence becomes sorted as well.  
>Input :  
>[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],  
> [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],  
> [1, 2, 3],  
> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],  
> [2, 1, 3, 2]]  
> Output :  
> [7, 5, 3, 1, 2]
